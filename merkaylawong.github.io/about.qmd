Hello, My Name is Merkayla!**

üë©‚Äçüé® I am an industrial design student from Singapore, currently studying at the National University of Singapore at the National University of Singapore, Division of Industrial Design.\
‚Äç\
üé®üñåÔ∏è Previously, I studied Visual Arts at the School of the Arts, Singapore. To me, design is a way of life. I am interested in the endless possibilities in which design can influence the world around. I believe norms and conventions should continuously questioned to create new products and experiences.\
